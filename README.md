# VHDL ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

## Introduction

Following INSA Lectures, making an ALU has been requested to learn the basics of VHDL.
In this repository you can find two `.vhd` files :
  - `alu.vhd` which is the core ALU written in VHDL
  - `sim_alu.vhd` the test component of the ALU

## Compiling

Because each VHDL files are using proprietary IEEE libraries, you may not be able to compile these files with GHDL.
However, you can use Xillinx Vivado or other VHDL compilers that are not open sources.
